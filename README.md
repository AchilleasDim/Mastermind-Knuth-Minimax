3.	A user should be able to select to play against another player or against the computer.

7.	The single-player mode will have three different levels of difficulty.
8.	If the user wishes to make it easier, he/she could ask for a hint at any given turn (after the first turn of course). (the minimax algorithm will be used to determine what the appropriate hint is)
9.	In the multiplayer mode, the two players will be able to configure a) whether they will play with hints b) what the added time per hint will be.
10.	The answer of the codebreaker will be read by the computer so as to place the key-pegs automatically each time (feedback).
